        <li><strong>Lower Drug Spending System:</strong> France's healthcare system negotiates drug pricing, often costing significantly less than in the US.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Brand Economy:</strong> Many brands are French-made—thus no import markups or US retail premiums.</li>
        <li><strong>Mass Retailers like City Pharma:</strong> Famous in Paris for steep discounts—some products reportedly 40–70% cheaper than U.S. prices.</li>

        <li>Head to City Pharma early (opening around 8:30 a.m.) to avoid crowds—and you may snag the best prices before popular items sell out.</li>
        <li>Make a list with product photos and U.S. prices to compare quickly and ensure you're getting a deal.</li>
        <li>Use VAT refund (if applicable) to save even more—make sure you meet purchase minimum, and have the form stamped at customs.</li>
        <li>Ask the pharmacist—they're trained (unlike many US pharmacy staff) and can recommend equivalents or personalized products.</li>

We'll show you exactly how to navigate the VAT refund process, from the moment you enter that charming Belgian boutique to collecting your refund with TravelMoney's seamless service at the airport.</p>

    <p>Get ready to savor Belgian shopping excellence – because in Belgium, even your tax refunds come with the same attention to quality and craftsmanship that makes this country famous worldwide!</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">1. Before shopping</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">a. How much is VAT in Belgium</h2>
    <p>Belgium's VAT system - called BTW (Belasting over de Toegevoegde Waarde) in Dutch and TVA (Taxe sur la Valeur Ajoutée) in French - is already included in every price you see. Here's the breakdown:</p>

    <div class="bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Standard Rate (21%):</strong> Your primary savings target! Applies to most goods including fashion, electronics, jewelry, cosmetics, luxury items, and typical tourist purchases</li>
        <li><strong>Intermediate Rate (12%):</strong> Restaurant meals (excluding alcohol), certain social housing, and specific agricultural supplies</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Rate (6%):</strong> Essential goods like basic food items, books, newspapers, medicines, public transport, and cultural services</li>
        <li><strong>Zero Rate (0%):</strong> Exports, intra-EU supplies, and certain exempt transactions</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Belgium's 21% standard rate means excellent savings potential - up to 17% of your purchase price after processing fees.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">b. Who can get a VAT refund and are you eligible?</h2>
    <p>You qualify if you:</p>
    <div class="bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>Live permanently outside the EU (including post-Brexit UK)</li>
        <li>Are at least 18 years old</li>
        <li>Stay in Belgium for less than 6 months (183 days in a 12-month period)</li>
        <li>Spend at least €125 per invoice (including VAT) - Belgium's high threshold requires strategic shopping!</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>You don't qualify if you:</p>
    <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>Work for travel/transport companies during your visit</li>
        <li>Are an EU resident (unless you live outside the EU with proof of residence)</li>
        <li>Are a student or long-term worker in the EU</li>
        <li>Make commercial purchases (goods must be for personal use)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">c. What you can (and can't) refund</h2>
    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
      <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-800 mb-4">Refund-eligible items:</h3>
        <p>Fashion, accessories, cosmetics, electronics, jewelry, watches, Belgian specialties (chocolates, diamonds, lace, designer leather goods), luxury items - anything physical for personal use</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-red-800 mb-4">Not eligible:</h3>
        <p>Services (hotels, restaurants, tours), consumables used in Belgium (food, drinks, chocolates eaten locally), tobacco and alcohol products, second-hand items, commercial quantities</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">d. Which shops provide tax refund</h2>
    <p>Before exploring Belgium's shopping treasures, look for stores displaying "Tax-Free Shopping," "TravelMoney," "Global Blue," "BTW/TVA Teruggave," or "VAT Refund" signs. Major areas like Brussels' Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert, Antwerp's diamond district, and luxury shopping streets participate widely. High-end chocolate shops, diamond dealers, and luxury boutiques typically offer tax-free shopping. When in doubt, ask: "Bieden jullie BTW-teruggave?" (Dutch) or "Offrez-vous le remboursement de TVA?" (French).</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">2. During shopping</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">a. Requesting an invoice</h2>
    <p>This step is crucial for TravelMoney processing. Before paying, request that your invoice shows:</p>
    <div class="bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Name:</strong> "Travel Money" (not your personal name)</li>
        <li><strong>Address:</strong> 14 rue Charles V 75004 Paris</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Belgian shopping strategy: With Belgium's €125 minimum threshold, plan your purchases strategically! Consider combining items at luxury stores or focus on high-value Belgian specialties like designer chocolates, premium diamonds, or luxury leather goods to reach the threshold efficiently.</p>
    <p class="font-semibold text-travel-blue">Remember: Belgian customs are thorough about checking unused goods with original tags!</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">3. Right after shopping</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">a. Upload the invoice and receipt immediately</h2>
    <p>Fire up the TravelMoney app while you're still savoring that Belgian shopping experience:</p>
    <div class="bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>Photograph invoices and receipts clearly</li>
        <li>Ensure all details are visible (store name, amount, date, BTW/TVA rate)</li>
        <li>Note whether receipts are in Dutch or French for reference</li>
        <li>Double-check and edit any incorrect information in the app</li>
        <li>Look for TravelMoney or other tax-free company logos</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">b. Complete your profile</h2>
    <p>Your refund depends on complete documentation:</p>
    <div class="bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>Upload your passport photo</li>
        <li>Enter your home address</li>
        <li>EU citizens living abroad: provide proof of non-EU residence</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">4. Before you leave Belgium (or the EU)</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">a. End your trip in the app</h2>
    <p class="font-semibold text-travel-blue">Critical timing: End your trip in the TravelMoney app at least 2 hours before departure to generate your electronic tax-free forms.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">b. The DIVA kiosk moment</h2>
    <p>Belgium offers both electronic validation and traditional manual processing. With TravelMoney's dedicated service:</p>

    <div class="bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-travel-blue mb-4">Your streamlined experience:</h3>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">c. Where to find DIVA kiosks</h2>
    <p>Keep all purchased items unused with original tags and packaging in accessible luggage. Belgian customs may inspect goods, especially high-value items like diamonds or luxury goods.</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">1. Before shopping</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">a. How much is VAT in Portugal</h2>
    <p>Portugal's VAT system - called IVA (Imposto sobre o Valor Acrescentado) - is already included in every price you see. The rates vary by location.</p>

    <div class="space-y-6">
      <div class="bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-travel-blue mb-4">Mainland Portugal:</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
          <li><strong>Standard Rate (23%):</strong> Europe's highest VAT rate and your biggest savings opportunity! Applies to luxury goods, fashion, electronics, jewelry, cosmetics, and most tourist purchases</li>
          <li><strong>Intermediate Rate (13%):</strong> Restaurants, hotels, wine, certain food items, and cultural services</li>
          <li><strong>Reduced Rate (6%):</strong> Basic necessities, books, newspapers, medicines, and passenger transport</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-800 mb-4">Azores (Lower Rates!):</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>Standard Rate (16%) instead of 23%</li>
          <li>Intermediate Rate (9%) instead of 13%</li>
          <li>Reduced Rate (4%) instead of 6%</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-4">Madeira (Slightly Lower):</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>Standard Rate (22%) instead of 23%</li>
          <li>Intermediate Rate (12%) instead of 13%</li>
          <li>Reduced Rate (5%) instead of 6%</li>

    <p class="mt-6">That massive 23% mainland rate means extraordinary savings potential - over €230 back on a €1,000 shopping spree!</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">b. Who can get a VAT refund, and are you eligible?</h2>
    <p>You qualify if you:</p>
    <div class="bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">

        <li>Are at least 16 years old</li>
        <li>Stay in Portugal for less than 6 months</li>
        <li>Spend at least €50 per invoice (one of Europe's lowest thresholds!)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>You don't qualify if you:</p>
    <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>Work for travel/transport companies during your visit</li>
        <li>Are an EU resident (unless you live outside the EU with proof of residence)</li>
        <li>Make commercial purchases (goods must be for personal/family use)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">c. What You Can (and Can't) Refund</h2>
    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
      <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-800 mb-4">Refund-eligible items:</h3>
        <p>Clothing, accessories, cosmetics, leather goods, electronics, home décor, jewelry, watches, Portuguese crafts (cork products, azulejo tiles, gold filigree) - anything physical for personal use</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-red-800 mb-4">Not eligible:</h3>
        <p>Services (hotels, restaurants, tours), consumables used in Portugal (food, drinks), tobacco, alcohol, second-hand items, commercial quantities</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">d. Which shops provide tax refund</h2>
    <p>Before exploring Portugal's shopping treasures, look for stores displaying "Tax-Free Shopping," "TravelMoney," "Global Blue," "e-TaxFree," or "VAT Refund" signs. Major shopping areas in Lisbon's Chiado, Porto's Santa Catarina, and tourist zones participate widely. International brands and Portuguese specialty stores (cork, ceramics, textiles) typically offer tax-free shopping. When in doubt, ask: "Oferecem reembolso de IVA?"</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">2. During shopping</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">a. Requesting an invoice</h2>
    <p>This step is crucial for TravelMoney processing. Before paying, request that your invoice shows:</p>
    <div class="bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Name:</strong> "Travel Money" (not your personal name)</li>
        <li><strong>Address:</strong> 14 rue Charles V 75004 Paris</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Portuguese Shopping Tip: Portuguese sales staff are known for their helpfulness with international visitors. They'll be happy to accommodate your invoice requirements, especially in tourist areas where tax-free shopping is common.</p>
    <p class="font-semibold text-travel-blue">Don't forget to keep your purchases pristine - Portuguese customs are thorough about checking unused goods with original tags!</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">3. Right after shopping</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">a. Upload the invoice and receipt immediately</h2>
    <p>Fire up the TravelMoney app while you're still enjoying that Portuguese shopping experience:</p>
    <div class="bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>Photograph invoices and receipts clearly</li>
        <li>Ensure all details are visible (store name, amount, date, IVA rate)</li>
        <li>Note which region you're shopping in (mainland vs Azores vs Madeira rates differ!)</li>
        <li>Double-check and edit any incorrect information in the app</li>
        <li>Look for TravelMoney or e-TaxFree logos on receipts</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">b. Complete your profile</h2>
    <p>Your refund depends on complete documentation:</p>
    <div class="bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>Upload your passport photo</li>
        <li>Enter your home address</li>
        <li>EU citizens living abroad: provide proof of non-EU residence</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">4. Before you leave Portugal (or the EU)</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">a. End your trip in the app</h2>
    <p class="font-semibold text-travel-blue">Critical timing: End your trip in the TravelMoney app at least 2 hours before departure to generate your electronic tax-free forms.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">b. The e-TaxFree validation Moment</h2>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">c. Where to Find e-TaxFree Kiosks</h2>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">Complete Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

    <p class="text-lg">Spain beckons travelers with its vibrant culture, stunning coastlines, and world-class shopping scene. From the fashion-forward streets of Madrid to Barcelona's designer boutiques, Spain offers an incredible retail landscape featuring iconic brands like Zara, Mango, Camper, and Loewe alongside luxury international labels.</p>

    <p>But here's the best part: as a non-EU visitor, you can make your Spanish shopping spree even more rewarding by claiming back the VAT (Value Added Tax) on your purchases. With Spain's 21% standard VAT rate, the savings can be substantial – imagine getting back over €200 on a €1,000 shopping haul!</p>

    <p>Whether you're hunting for leather goods in Seville, designer fashion in Barcelona, or artisanal crafts in San Sebastián, this comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about tax-free shopping in Spain. We'll show you exactly how to navigate the VAT refund process, from the moment you enter a store to collect your refund at the airport.</p>

    <div class="bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-xl my-8">
      <p class="font-semibold text-yellow-800 mb-2">Please note:</p>
      <p>This guide covers tax-free shopping on mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands. Different rules apply for purchases made in the Canary Islands, Ceuta, and Melilla.</p>
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">1. Before shopping</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">a. How much is VAT in Spain</h2>
    <p>Spain's VAT system - called IVA (Impuesto sobre el Valor Añadido) - is already included in every price tag you see. Here's what you'll encounter:</p>

    <div class="bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Standard Rate (21%):</strong> Your main target for big savings. Applies to fashion, electronics, jewelry, cosmetics, luxury goods, and most tourist purchases</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Rate (10%):</strong> Restaurants, hotels, cinema tickets, transportation, and some food items</li>
        <li><strong>Super-Reduced (4%):</strong> Basic necessities like bread, milk, books, and medicines</li>
        <li><strong>Zero Rate (0%):</strong> Medical services, education, and certain cultural activities</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>That hefty 21% standard rate means serious money back in your pocket, making the potential VAT refund quite substantial on higher-value purchases.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">b. Who can get a VAT refund, and are you eligible?</h2>
    <p>You're eligible for VAT refunds in Spain if you permanently reside outside the European Union. This includes non-EU citizens as well as EU passport holders who live in countries outside the EU.</p>

    <p>You qualify if you:</p>
    <div class="bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>Live permanently outside the EU (including post-Brexit UK)</li>
        <li>Are at least 16 years old</li>
        <li>Stay in Spain for less than 6 months</li>
        <li>No minimum purchase requirement (Spain eliminated this in recent years!)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <p class="font-semibold text-green-800 mb-2">Special eligibility:</p>
      <p>Residents of the Canary Islands, Ceuta, and Melilla can also claim refunds on mainland purchases.</p>
    </div>

    <p>You don't qualify if you:</p>
    <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>Work for travel/transport companies during your visit</li>
        <li>Are an EU resident (unless you live outside the EU with proof of residence)</li>
        <li>Purchase items in the Canary Islands, Ceuta, or Melilla (these have different tax systems)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">c. What you can (and can't) refund</h2>
    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
      <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-800 mb-4">Refund-eligible items:</h3>
        <p>Clothing, accessories, cosmetics, leather goods, electronics, home décor, jewelry, watches, sports equipment - basically anything physical for personal use</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-red-800 mb-4">Not eligible:</h3>
        <p>Services (hotels, restaurants), second-hand items, consumables used in Spain (food, drinks), tobacco, alcohol, vehicle fuel, commercial quantities</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">d. Which shops provide tax refund</h2>
    <p>Before hitting the streets, look for stores displaying "Tax-Free Shopping," "DIVA," or "VAT Refund" signs. About 90% of stores in major tourist areas like Madrid and Barcelona participate. Department stores like El Corte Inglés, luxury boutiques, and international brands are your best bets. When in doubt, simply ask: "¿Ofrecen devolución de IVA?"</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">2. During shopping</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">a. Requesting an invoice</h2>
    <p>This step is crucial for TravelMoney processing. Before paying, request that your invoice shows:</p>
    <div class="bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Name:</strong> "Travel Money" (not your personal name)</li>
        <li><strong>Address:</strong> [INSERT Spanish Address]</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <p class="font-semibold text-yellow-800 mb-2">Pro tip:</p>
      <p>Save any store loyalty cards for after the invoice is processed. Spanish point-of-sale systems often auto-populate personal details when cards are scanned first, making it difficult to change afterward.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="font-semibold text-travel-blue">The store is legally required to provide an invoice with your requested details - don't hesitate to ask!</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">3. Right after shopping</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">a. Upload the invoice and receipt immediately</h2>
    <p>Fire up the TravelMoney app while you're still buzzing from your Spanish shopping spree:</p>
    <div class="bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>Photograph invoices and receipts clearly</li>
        <li>Ensure all details are visible (store name, amount, date, IVA rate)</li>
        <li>Double-check and edit any incorrect information in the app</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">b. Complete your profile</h2>
    <p>Your refund depends on complete documentation:</p>
    <div class="bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>Upload your passport photo</li>
        <li>Enter your home address</li>
        <li>EU citizens living abroad: provide proof of non-EU residence</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">4. Before you leave Spain (or the EU)</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">a. End your trip in the app</h2>
    <p class="font-semibold text-travel-blue">Critical timing: End your trip in the TravelMoney app at least 2 hours before departure to generate your electronic refund documents (DER/DIVA forms).</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">b. The DIVA kiosk experience</h2>
    <p>Spain's digital VAT refund system uses DIVA kiosks instead of manual stamps. Before security or check-in, locate a DIVA terminal and scan your form's barcode:</p>

    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
      <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-800 mb-4">Green screen = ¡Perfecto!</h3>
        <p>You're all set for departure.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-red-800 mb-4">Red screen = Head to Customs</h3>
        <p>Head to the nearby Customs office (Civil Guard) for manual validation.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">c. Where to find DIVA kiosks</h2>
    <p>Keep purchased items in carry-on luggage - Customs may want to inspect them. All items must be unused and unopened. No exceptions, even for that tempting Spanish chocolate!</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-travel-blue mt-6 mb-4">Where to find DIVA kiosks</h3>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">d. Keep purchases handy</h2>
    <p>Pack smart for inspection - keep all purchased items unused with original tags in accessible luggage. Spanish customs may inspect goods, and everything must be pristine and unused.</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">5. Returning Home</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">a. Know your country's rules</h2>
    <p>Different countries have different duty-free thresholds. US travelers face potential duties on goods over $800. Research your home country's regulations and always declare purchases honestly to avoid complications.</p>
    <p>Remember: You have up to 4 years to send validated DIVA forms to Spanish retailers if you choose the direct refund route, but TravelMoney processes your refund much faster!</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">d. Which shops provide tax refund</h2>
    <p>Before you start your Italian shopping adventure, look for stores displaying "Tax-Free Shopping," "TravelMoney," "Global Blue," "Planet," or "VAT Refund" signs. Most luxury boutiques in Milan, Rome, Florence, and Venice participate. Gucci, Prada, Versace, and major department stores are guaranteed participants. TravelMoney partner stores offer the smoothest experience with direct processing. When in doubt, ask: "Offrite il rimborso IVA?"</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">2. During shopping</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">a. Requesting an invoice</h2>
    <p>While shopping in Italian stores, make your VAT refund intentions clear from the start. Ask the sales associate a tax-free form during your purchase. The store will create an electronic invoice through Italy's OTELLO system, so double-check that all your details are perfectly accurate – your name spelling, passport number, and home address must match your travel documents exactly.</p>

    <div class="bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <p class="font-semibold text-yellow-800 mb-2">Italian customs are particularly strict about one golden rule:</p>
      <p>Keep everything pristine! Don't remove a single tag, don't try on that gorgeous leather jacket one more time, and resist the urge to use your new Italian treasures until you're safely home. Your purchases must remain completely unused with all original tags and packaging intact – think of them as museum pieces until you clear customs.</p>
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">3. Right after shopping</h1>

From Munich's luxury Maximilianstrasse to Berlin's trendy Hackescher Markt, Hamburg's elegant shopping arcades to Cologne's bustling pedestrian zones, Germany offers an outstanding retail landscape featuring world-renowned German brands like Adidas, Puma, Hugo Boss, and Birkenstock alongside prestigious international luxury labels.</p>

    <p>But here's the best part: as a non-EU visitor, you can make your German shopping adventure even more rewarding by claiming back the VAT (Value Added Tax) on your purchases.

    <p>Whether you're discovering precision timepieces in Munich, high-tech gadgets in Berlin, designer fashion in Düsseldorf, or traditional crafts in the Black Forest, this comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about tax-free shopping in Germany. We'll show you exactly how to navigate the VAT refund process, from the moment you step into that first boutique to collecting your refund with TravelMoney's efficient service at the airport.</p>

    <p>Get ready to experience German engineering precision in shopping – because in Germany, even your tax refunds are systematically organized for maximum efficiency!</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">1. Before shopping</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">a. How much is VAT in Germany</h2>
    <p>Germany's VAT system – called Mehrwertsteuer (MwSt) – is already included in every price you see. Here's the straightforward breakdown:</p>

    <div class="bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl mb-8">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Standard Rate (19%):</strong> Your main savings target. Applies to most goods including fashion, electronics, jewelry, cosmetics, luxury items, and typical tourist purchases</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Rate (7%):</strong> Books, newspapers, food items, hotel accommodations, cultural events, and public transportation</li>
        <li><strong>Zero Rate (0%):</strong> Exports, intra-EU supplies, and certain medical services</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Germany's 19% standard rate means solid savings potential - up to 16% of your purchase price after processing fees.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">b. Who can get a VAT refund, and are you eligible?</h2>
    <p>You qualify if you:</p>
    <div class="bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>Live permanently outside the EU (including post-Brexit UK)</li>
        <li>Are at least 18 years old</li>
        <li>Stay in Germany for less than 3 months without a residence permit</li>
        <li>Spend at least €50 per invoice (varies by operator and store)</li>
        <li>Depart on a non-stop flight to a non-EU country (unique German requirement)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>You don't qualify if you:</p>
    <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>Work for travel/transport companies during your visit</li>
        <li>Are an EU resident (unless you live outside the EU with proof of residence)</li>
        <li>Hold a German residence permit longer than 3 months</li>
        <li>Purchase items for commercial use</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">c. What you can (and can't) refund</h2>
    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
      <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-800 mb-4">Refund-eligible items:</h3>
        <p>Clothing, accessories, cosmetics, electronics, jewelry, watches, German specialties (cuckoo clocks, beer steins, traditional crafts) - anything physical for personal use</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-red-800 mb-4">Not eligible:</h3>
        <p>Services (hotels, restaurants, repairs, transportation), vehicle-related items (car parts, fuel, accessories), items consumed in Germany (food, drinks), second-hand goods</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">d. Which shops provide tax refund</h2>
    <p>Before exploring Germany's shopping districts, look for stores displaying "Tax-Free Shopping," "TravelMoney," "Global Blue," or "Mehrwertsteuer-Erstattung" signs. Major shopping areas in Munich's pedestrian zone, Berlin's Potsdamer Platz, Düsseldorf's Königsallee, and Frankfurt's Zeil participate widely. International brands and German specialty stores typically offer tax-free shopping. When in doubt, ask: "Bieten Sie Mehrwertsteuer-Erstattung?" (Do you offer VAT refund?)</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">2. During shopping</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">a. Requesting an invoice</h2>
    <p>This step is crucial for TravelMoney processing. Before paying, request that your invoice shows:</p>
    <div class="bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Name:</strong> "Travel Money" (not your personal name)</li>
        <li><strong>Address:</strong> 14 rue Charles V 75004 Paris</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-xl mb-6">
      <p class="font-semibold text-yellow-800 mb-2">German shopping tip:</p>
      <p>German sales staff are known for their helpfulness with international visitors. They'll be happy to accommodate your invoice requirements, especially in tourist areas where tax-free shopping is common.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Don't forget to keep your purchases pristine - German customs are thorough about checking unused goods with original tags!</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">3. Right after shopping</h1>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">a. Upload the invoice and receipt immediately</h2>
    <p>Fire up the TravelMoney app while you're still enjoying that German shopping experience:</p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>Photograph invoices and receipts clearly</li>
        <li>Ensure all details are visible (store name, amount, date, MwSt rate)</li>
        <li>Double-check and edit any incorrect information in the app</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-8 mb-4">b. Complete your profile</h2>
    <p>Your refund depends on complete documentation:</p>

    <p>Each year, thousands of international visitors take advantage of France's tax-free shopping program, yet many travelers remain unaware of this money-saving opportunity. This comprehensive guide explains everything you need to know about claiming your VAT refund in France – from eligibility requirements to the step-by-step refund process – helping you maximize savings on your French luxury purchases and souvenirs.</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">What is VAT and how much is it in France?</h1>
    <p>VAT (Value Added Tax) is a consumption tax added to most goods and services in France. Known locally as <span class="italic">TVA (Taxe sur la Valeur Ajoutée)</span>, this tax is already included in all displayed prices, unlike in countries like the US where tax is added at checkout.</p>

    <p>France applies different VAT rates depending on the type of goods:</p>

    <p>For tourist shopping, most purchases fall under the standard 20% rate. This means that for a €100 item, approximately €16.67 is tax (since €83.33 + 20% VAT = €100). This is the portion potentially refundable to non-EU visitors.</p>

    <p>Unlike in North America, where prices are shown pre-tax, all price tags in France already include the applicable VAT rate. For example, a €120 handbag in a Paris boutique already includes €20 of VAT within that displayed price.</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">How much is the VAT refund in France?</h1>
    <p>While the standard VAT rate in France is 20%, tourists typically receive refunds between <span class="font-semibold">12% and 20%</span> of their purchase price, depending on the refund method used.</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">Who can get a VAT refund?</h1>
    <p>There are several criteria but chances are if you're reading this guide you will be eligible to obtain your VAT refund when leaving Paris.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">To do so, you must:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 my-6 bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
      <li>Be a resident in a non-EU country, such as the United Kingdom, at the time of purchase.</li>
      <li>Have been in France for less than 6 months.</li>
      <li>Be at least 16 years old.</li>
      <li>Not be employed by a travel/transport company either, if you are working during your visit.</li>
      <li>Not be a resident of France or its overseas departments and territories.</li>
      <li>Have spent more than 100 euros – that's the minimum amount to be considered in order to get your VAT refund.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now you can't get a VAT refund on every purchase you make during your stay as there are some items which cannot be reimbursed, such as cultural goods, goods covered by the Washington Convention or narcotics, manufactured tobacco, petroleum products, weapons, or reimbursement on methods of transport for private use. That includes associated equipment and supplies such as food and fuel.</p>

    <p>All refunds must be validated through the PABLO system before leaving the EU, and typically within 3 months of purchase date.</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">PABLO Terminal Locations and Process</h1>
    <p>PABLO terminals are electronic validation stations found at international departure points throughout France, including:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 my-6">
      <li>Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (Terminals 1, 2A-2F)</li>
      <li>Paris Orly Airport (Terminals 1-4)</li>
      <li>Nice Côte d'Azur Airport</li>
      <li>Lyon-Saint Exupéry Airport</li>
      <li>Marseille Provence Airport</li>
      <li>Major train stations with international departures (Gare du Nord, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl my-8">
      <p class="font-medium mb-4">When using a PABLO terminal:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
        <li>Scan the barcode from your tax refund form(s) or TravelMoney app</li>
        <li>Follow on-screen instructions to complete validation</li>
        <li>Keep the stamped validation receipt as proof</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="bg-travel-blue/10 p-4 rounded-lg font-medium my-6"><span class="text-travel-blue">Important:</span> PABLO validation must be completed before checking luggage, as customs may request to inspect your purchases. Allow at least 30 minutes for this process during busy travel periods.</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">What is a Custom Invoice?</h1>
    <p>A custom invoice is a specialized receipt issued by the retailer that includes:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 my-6 bg-travel-blue/5 p-6 rounded-xl">
      <li>Your full name exactly as it appears on your passport</li>
      <li>Your permanent non-EU address</li>
      <li>Your passport number</li>
      <li>The VAT refund operator's name and details</li>
      <li>Itemized purchase information with VAT amounts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Unlike standard VAT refund forms which are pre-printed with the store's details, custom invoices streamline the process by allowing a single operator like TravelMoney to handle all your refunds together, regardless of where you shopped.</p>

    <p class="font-medium">To request a custom invoice, simply tell the retailer: <span class="italic">"I'd like a custom invoice for VAT refund through TravelMoney"</span> when making your purchase.</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-travel-blue mt-12 mb-6">Start Saving on Your French Shopping</h1>
    <p>By understanding the VAT refund process, you can save up to 20% on qualifying purchases during your visit to France. Whether you choose the traditional method or the streamlined TravelMoney approach, proper planning ensures you don't miss out on these significant savings.</p>
